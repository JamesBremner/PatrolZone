# PatrolZone
Designing Police Patrol Zones by Unsupervised Classification 

Implements a paper by Dinc & Dinc.  There is a copy of the paper in the doc folder. URL is https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8478908

The code in this repository uses the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to locate police stations ( blue dots ) at the center of historical crime locations ( red dots ).  The diagram is the result of a simulation run using random crime locations.
